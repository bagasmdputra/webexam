                                                        In 2014, founder and software engineer Adam fell in love with Tesla Motors &#8211; not just the cars, but the entire innovative nature of the company. He wanted one; he needed his own piece of real-life inspiration. This passion drove him to set up the first electric car hire business in Australia &#8211; Electric Ride &#8211; just so he could make his dream come true of owning a Tesla Model S.</p>
                                                        <p>With a driver running the hire company on weekdays, this left the weekend free for Adam to drive his pride and joy. But the software engineer within wasn’t satisfied &#8211; he didn’t want to rely on anyone else for on-demand bookings.</p>
                                                        <p>
                                                        </p></div><div class="col-sm-6">
                                                        <p>So he set about creating his own system. Before too long, a brand new software platform began to emerge, one that could deftly handle the entire process of booking, dispatch and payment.</p>
                                                        <p>Realising he was onto something even bigger, Adam put the finishing touches to v1 of the platform so that it could handle almost any type of service-based business. He then set to work assembling an experienced executive team to help him take the offering to market. Riyo was born.</p>
